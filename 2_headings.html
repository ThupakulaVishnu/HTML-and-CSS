    HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visible or 
    audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these 
    characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are 
    mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which describes the features of early text 
    formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible 
    Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to 
    manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges 
    with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been progressively moved in 
    this direction with CSS.
