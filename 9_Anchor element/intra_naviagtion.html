            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the 
            meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to 
            describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
            "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single 
            website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content 
            to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active 
            participant in the World Wide Web.An HTML element is set off from other text in a document 
            by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by . The name of an element 
            inside a tag is case-insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a 
            mixture. For example, the  tag can be written as , or in any other way.
            However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.

            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a 
            document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS 
            describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
            CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now just "CSS" with individual CSS modules having version numbers.
            After CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress on different CSS modules started to differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and release recommendations separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable state of the CSS specification and individual modules progress. CSS modules now have version numbers, or levels, such as CSS Color Module Level 5</p>

            <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, garbage-collected, dynamic language, supporting multiple paradigms such as imperative, functional, and object-oriented.
            JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation (via eval), object introspection (via for...in and Object utilities), and source-code recovery (JavaScript functions store their source text and can be retrieved through toString()).
            This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or other host environments. For information about APIs that are specific to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM.
            The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402). As soon as one browser implements a feature, we try to document it. This means that cases where some proposals for new ECMAScript features have already been implemented in browsers, documentation and examples in MDN articles may use some of those new features. Most of the time, this happens between the stages 3 and 4, and is usually before the spec is officially published.
            Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language — JavaScript is not "Interpreted Java". Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and use.
            JavaScript documentation of core language features (pure ECMAScript, for the most part) includes the following:</p>

            <p>As its official tagline states, React is a library for building user interfaces. React is not a framework – it's not even exclusive to the web. It's used with other libraries to render to certain environments. For instance, React Native can be used to build mobile applications.
                To build for the web, developers use React in tandem with ReactDOM. React and ReactDOM are often discussed in the same spaces as — and utilized to solve the same problems as — other true web development frameworks. When we refer to React as a "framework", we're working with that colloquial understanding.
                React's primary goal is to minimize the bugs that occur when developers are building UIs. It does this through the use of components — self-contained, logical pieces of code that describe a portion of the user interface. These components can be composed together to create a full UI, and React abstracts away much of the rendering work, leaving you to concentrate on the UI design.
                Unlike the other frameworks covered in this module, React does not enforce strict rules around code conventions or file organization. This allows teams to set conventions that work best for them, and to adopt React in any way they would like to. React can handle a single button, a few pieces of an interface, or an app's entire user interface.
                While React can be used for small pieces of an interface, it's not as easy to "drop into" an application as a library like jQuery, or even a framework like Vue — it is more approachable when you build your entire app with React.
                In addition, many of the developer-experience benefits of a React app, such as writing interfaces with JSX, require a compilation process. Adding a compiler like Babel to a website makes the code on it run slowly, so developers often set up such tooling with a build step. React arguably has a heavy tooling requirement, but it can be learned.
                This article is going to focus on the use case of using React to render the entire user interface of an application with the support of Vite, a modern front-end build tool.</p>
