        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the 
            meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to 
            describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
            "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single 
            website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content 
            to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active 
            participant in the World Wide Web.An HTML element is set off from other text in a document 
            by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by < and >. The name of an element 
            inside a tag is case-insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a 
            mixture. For example, the <title> tag can be written as <Title>, <TITLE>, or in any other way.
            However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.</p>
